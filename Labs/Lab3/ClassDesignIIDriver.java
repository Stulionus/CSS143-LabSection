    /*
    On observing the execution of the demo code, answer the following questions...

    What is the primary difference between passing a primitive to a method versus passing an object?
        Primitive is passed by value meaning that you cannot change it value in main through argument while object is passed by reference,
        and therefore it's value in main was changed.
    When a primitive is passed to a method, does the scope of that primitive change (i.e., grow to include the called method)?
        No.
    What about when an object is passed to a method?
        Technically no.
    How then would you describe the scope of an object that has been passed to a method?
        I think that more accurate would be to say that the scope of the object has not changed but there is now a new
        object with different scope, but they both are stored in the same place in memory.
