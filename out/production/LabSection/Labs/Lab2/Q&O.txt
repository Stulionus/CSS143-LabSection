   1) Why did we do so much copying-and-pasting in our software above?
        How can this approach be problematic?

        We did so much copying-and-pasting because many objects that we have been working wit have multiple similar
        properties and actions.

        This can be solved by class inheritance

    2)Are there obvious improvements that could be made here with respect the software design for Squares and Circles?

    There should be one class called shapes that would contain properties that any shape will hve like position and
    then there will be classes that inherit from shapes and have their own properties and functions

   3)What programming constructs were you familiar with, and which did you need to look up?

    I was familiar with all of them except list of objets but i did not look it up since it is very similar to array of int

   4)Assume we used a separate array for Squares and for Circles rather than one unifying Object array.
        How would this complicate the task of adding a new Shape (say, a Triangle) to our ObjectList class?

        We will have to create an entire new array to store new type of shapes and that would take up more memmory space
